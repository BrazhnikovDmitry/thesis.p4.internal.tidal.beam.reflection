This chapter addresses how the internal tidal beam scattered by continental margin in Tasmania. It is shown:
1) There are two different regions for energy lost
2) Energy incident on two sites is set up by interaction with ETP
3) The averaged energy transfers can largely change by excited slope mode, read Jody, Chapman and Dale
4) Slope mode excitation varies
5) Offshore mesoscale shapes the beam and slope response additionally.
